The Android Security Team regularly receives requests for information about preventing potential security issues on Android devices. We also occasionally spot check devices and let device manufacturers and affected partners know of potential issues.

This page provides security best practices based on our experiences, extending the Designing for Security documentation we've provided for developers and includes details unique to building or installing system-level software on devices.

To facilitate adoption of these best practices, where possible the Android Security Team incorporates tests into the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) and Android Lint. We encourage partners to contribute tests that can help other Android users (view security-related tests at root/cts/tests/tests/security/src/android/security/cts).
